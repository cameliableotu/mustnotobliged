<p> Welcome! In this experiment, you will have to read certain sentences in various contexts and choose the interpretation that seems more appropriate.</p>
<p> Then you will have to rate how acceptable/natural the sentences seem to you on a scale from 1 (fully unacceptable) to 7 (fully acceptable).</p>
<p> Do not judge the sentences in terms of school grammar, simply follow your own intuition.</p>
